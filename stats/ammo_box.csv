UK-MG Ammo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Description:,````Ammo Bins contain the rounds needed for projectile-based weaponry` with at least one bin required per weapon type.  Most Ammo Bins will explode and destroy their installed location when they receive a Critical Hit` however Ultra-Kinetic Machine Gun ammunition is made up of solid high-tech metal alloy metals engineered to have a custom-structured atomic structure` thanks to an open-standard technology developed and by Westonmach.  This solid alloy material makes up all of the rounds` and there is no casing` gunpowder` or chemical components` explosive or otherwise.  As such` there isn't any part of the ammunition to explode or burn if the ammunition or it's storage container gets damaged or even set on fire in combat` so no explosion will occur from a critical hit.\n\n````Ultra-Kinetic Machine Gun Ammo Bins may feed multiple weapons` which do not have to be installed in the same location` thanks to a battlemech's internal mechanisms which feed and transfer ammunition around inside of a battlemech's parts` like any other ammunition bins.\n\n````Westonmach ammuntion bins use magical extradimensional technology to fit their ammunition into a space smaller than the total cubic area of all of the ammunition itself.  In battlemechs` this comes at the cost of weakened total armor for the battlemech` because of the magistics that apply` however the smallest capacity ammunition box of it's type usually does not incur any such tradeoff.  Also` larger capacity ammunition bins will impair the battlemech's cooling capabilities` resulting in a small to moderate reduction in the overheating threshold and also the maximum amount of heat the battlemech can take.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wastemaker Auto Cannon Ammo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Description:,````Ammo Bins contain the rounds needed for projectile-based weaponry` with at least one bin required per weapon type.  Most Ammo Bins will explode and destroy their installed location when they receive a Critical Hit` although Wastemaker Cannon ammunition is completely made up of a shaped slug` with no casing` no warhead` and no chemical or explosive propellant of any kind as it relies on the cannon shooting it to propel it through the air.  As such` it will not explode while inside of an ammunition bin that gets hit or damaged` and is therefore not a fire or explosion hazard.  Wastemaker rounds differ from Reaper Auto Cannon rounds in these ways` as well as the rounds and the guns that fire them being smaller.  Wastemaker rounds are made of solid high-tech metal alloy metals engineered to have a custom-structured atomic structure` thanks to an open-standard technology developed and by Gralthler.  Wastemaker Auto Cannon rounds use a technology other than archaic methods involving gunpowder` etc.` to propel the rounds.\n\n````Wastemaker Auto Cannon Ammo Bins may feed multiple weapons` which do not have to be installed in the same location` thanks to a battlemech's internal mechanisms which feed and transfer ammunition around inside of a battlemech's parts` like any other ammunition bins.\n\n````Gralthler weapon ammuntion bins use magical extradimensional technology to fit their ammunition into a space smaller than the total cubic area of all of the ammunition itself.  In Battlemechs` this comes at the cost of weakened total armor for the battlemech` because of the magistics that apply` however the smallest capacity ammunition box of it’s type usually does not incur any such tradeoff.  Also` larger capacity ammunition bins will impair the battlemech’s cooling capabilities` resulting in a small to moderate reduction in the overheating threshold and also the maximum amount of heat the battlemech can take.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
